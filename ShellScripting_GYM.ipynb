            "Purpose: Functions are blocks of reusable code. They help organize scripts and avoid repetition.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Defining Functions\n",
            "Functions can be defined using the 'function' keyword or just the function name followed by parentheses.\n",
            "Syntax:\n",
            "function my_function {\n",
            "  # commands in the function\n",
            "}\n",
            "or\n",
            "my_function () {\n",
            "  # commands in the function\n",
            "}\n",
            "\n",
            "### Calling Functions\n",
            "To call a function, simply use its name.\n",
            "\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "greet_user () {\n",

            "Hello!\n",
            "\n",
            "### Passing Arguments to Functions\n",
            "Arguments are passed to functions by listing them after the function name when calling it.\n",
            "Inside the function, arguments are accessed using $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 is the function name, $# is the number of arguments, $* or $@ is all arguments).\n",
            "\n",
            "Example:\n",

            "### Returning Values from Functions\n",
            "Functions can return a status (0 for success, non-zero for failure) using the 'return' command. The return value can be accessed using $? after the function call.\n",
            "To return actual data (like a string or number), you typically print it to standard output and capture the output using command substitution.\n",
            "\n",
            "Example (returning status):\n",
            "check_file () {\n",

        "*   Fundamental bash commands (`echo`, `pwd`, `ls`) were explained and demonstrated with examples, common options, and their outputs.\n",
        "*   File and directory manipulation commands (`mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`) were demonstrated with examples showing their effect on the file system.\n",
        "*   Commands for viewing and searching file content (`cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`) were explained and demonstrated using sample files, including options for `head`, `tail`, and `grep`. Command-line text editors (`nano`, `vim`) were also introduced.\n",
        "*   File permissions and ownership were explained, demonstrating how to view permissions using `ls -l` and how to change them using `chmod` in both symbolic and octal modes. The `chown` and `chgrp` commands were also explained.\n",
        "*   Input/output redirection was covered, explaining standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) and demonstrating the use of `>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, `&>`, `> file 2>&1`, and the pipe operator (`|`) with examples.\n",

Two demo batch files (`hello.bat` and `variables.bat`) were created.
